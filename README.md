‚Ä¢ Deliverable: post your homework on Blackboard digital dropbox as a zipped file with the name ‚ÄúHW3- YourLastName, FirstName‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ Assignment #3 composed of two parts: Part I and Part II

High-Level Requirements:

1. For this project in Assignment #3, some tasks are missing and their sizes along with their corresponding productivity rates are unknown.

2. Use the productivity rates used in Assignment #1 and Assignment #2 to establish a baseline (the average of productivity rates for Assignment #1 and Assignment #2) for the Productivity Rates of Assignment #3

3. Use the size data for the different tasks used in Assignment #1 and

Assignment #2 to establish a baseline (the average size data for Assignment #1 and Assignment #2) as Estimates for the Size data of Assignment #3

4. Consider WBS for Assignment #1 and Assignment #2 to identity the activities and tasks for Assignment #3.

5. Use sound software engineering judgments for creating new tasks and estimating size of new tasks or their productivity rates; consider the data you have seen in other projects in Assignment #1 and Assignment #2 in your judgments

Part I

Identify and calculate the missing data in the following Estimation Baseline Table

Data Given

Walkthrough Example

Part II

Using the data spreadsheet provided below to achieve the following:

1. Use the Estimation Baseline calculated in Part I in the

creation of the project plan for Part II

2. Assume that you have been asked to create the project plan for this project after you have created the project plans for Assignment #1 and Assignment #2.

3. Assume it has been requested that this project be started on 3/22/21 after the project in Assignment#1 has been started and Assignment#2 has been started. The projects in Assignment#1 and Assignment#2 will use/share the same resources listed in Assignment#1 and Assignment#2.

4. Feed the information provided in this handout in MS Project to create the Project Plan and the Network Diagram

5. Create a WBS with the required phases and activities to complete this project

6. Assign the Resources to the Tasks making any assumptions you consider appropriate (Software Engineering Assumptions).

8. Can this project be completed 2 months after it starts? Explain why yes or no.

9. Submit your MS Project Files; submit all 3 project files.

10. Submit your Comments regarding the start and completion dates and resources assignments for the three projects in a PDF document called Analysis.pdf.

1. Document and comment on the WBS

2. Document and comment on the Network Diagram

3. Document and comment on the resource pool utilization

11. The two documents in step 9 and 10 shall be saved in a zipped file with name ‚ÄúHW#3- YourLastName, FirstName‚Äù.

Resources Available

Important Note: Use the resources listed in Assignment#1 and Assignment#2 in addition to the following resources:

‚Ä¢ Test Engineer: TE379. TE380, TE381, TE382, TE384, TE385, TE386

‚Ä¢ System Engineer: SE3379, SE380, SE381, SE382

‚Ä¢ Programmers/software engineers: PE379, PE380, PE381

‚Ä¢ Documentation Engineer: DE379, DE380, DE381, DE382

Assumptions and Constraints:

1. Use the same engineering assumptions used in Assignment #1 and Assignment #2.

Task/Activity Dependencies:

It is expected that you will find the correct task dependencies based on the material discussed during class and considering the following constraints:

1. There is no technical task prior to requirement phase; project planning is not a technical task it is a managerial task. However, process updates tasks must be completed before Requirements phase starts.

2. Analysis Activity can start as soon as requirement document is complete

3. Design activity can start as soon as Analysis document is complete

4. Coding can start as soon as design is complete

5. Writing Test Plan can start as soon as requirements are complete

6. Executing Test Plan can start as soon as coding is complete

7. Documentation can start as soon as requirements are complete

8. Any other constraints that you might add, shall be documented clearly when you submit your homework.

9. Build the development and testing lab environment task must be completed before design starts and as soon as the project plan is complete.

10. Any engineer can update the software development process and any engineer can review or fix defects in the changes made to the software development process
